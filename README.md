# GameEngine

![Game Engine Banner](assets/Logo4.png)

#### A simple game engine by me. To use it, run the fallowing commands:

```
$ mkdir build  /Look at Important
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ ./LostInTime
```

## Important
* You don't need to run 'mkdir build' if there is already a build directory
* The executable name might differ so you can check that out
* For any other problem that you could have, you can always contact me
